# 300 - Building a Base Docker Application

Before jumping to exporting or saving Docker containers and images, you first need to build an application you’ll use for sharing purposes. You’ll build a basic arithmetic solution as a sample Docker application via a command-line environment.

1. Create a file for your project named Dockerfile, and paste the code below into the newly created Dockerfile.

```
$ cd containers/app/arithmetic
$ touch Dockerfile.dev
```

The code below performs a basic arithmetic operation that results in a value of 10.

```

```
containers/app/arithmetic/Dockerfile.dev
