# 500 - Importing Docker Containers

Instead of exporting, perhaps you need to import a Docker container that a teammate shared with you. If so, the [docker import](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/import/) command is what you need. The ```docker import``` command takes the exported filesystem and converts it into an image filesystem you can run on your machine.

1. Run the following ```docker``` command to ```import``` a container (```arithmetic.tar```) and convert it to an image. When importing, you must attach a tag (```latest```) and name the image (```put_any_name_here```), as shown below.

```
$ cd containers/app/arithmetic
$ docker import arithmetic.tar put_any_name_here:latest
```
