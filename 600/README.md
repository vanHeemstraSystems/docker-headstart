# 600 - Saving Images via Docker Save Image

Perhaps you want to save a Docker image rather than a container. If so, go with the ```docker save image``` command instead. Unlike the ```docker export``` command, the ```docker save``` command lets save one or more images to a tar archive directly and share it with anyone.

**Note**: you can only save and load Docker images, not containers.
